                        A man who loves music and cars to the point where people could argue its an unhealthy habit to
                        be spending that much on these hobbies.
                        <br><br> A developer in training in the day and an extrovert at night living a double life to
                        enjoy everything to the fullest.
                        <br><br> He plans to work with cloud services mainly in the future but is comfortable with any
                        full-stack development opportunities.
                        <br><br> Go check out some of his projects here: <a

                        Dennis is a creative genius. The mastermind behind most of what you see on this website stems
                        from his creative instincts.
                        <br> Also a developer in training, he spends his off time with his loved ones (mainly a corgi)
                        and enjoys talking about and sometimes working on his own car.
                        <br><br> Undecided at the moment but enjoys his time with front-end development with a nice
                        focus towards ux/ui.

                        You always want an Isaac on the team. What I mean by that is someone who's caring, thoughtful,
                        and always great at picking the initiative no matter how dreadful the task.
                        <br> Another bright BCIT student in the CST program, he has a passion for bikes and can talk
                        about it for hours on hand if you let him.
                        <br><br> Undecided on what to persue in the future in the field of Software Development, he's
                        leaning towards some nice front-end work.
