                        Through this application, we have included a shopping option that takes you to a version of
                        various companies where you can also donate to your specified charities. Simply use the
                        menu-shop option and it will take you to a list of potential companies to shop from. Once you
                        choose your option, purchase your desired items, then, in the checkout menu, you will be able to
                        select a charity and amount to donate.

                        FundCart offers a web extension that works on non-cellular devices. You will find an option in
                        the menu to download this extention. Once you have it, you will be offered the opportunity to
                        donate money to charities from the checkout menu.

                        FundCart offers a description of all potential charities in the "charities" section of the menu.
                        From there, you could also navigate to the charities website for even more information about
                        them.

                        If the extention is not displaying your donation options at checkout, try using a different
                        browser, like google chrome. If the problem continues, you can email us at support@FundCart.com
                        or use the chatbox option in the botton right corner of the screen to contact someone to help
                        you.

                    <div class="answer">
                        FundCart is a tool, designed to help people with busy lives, to still find the time to donate to
                        causes that are important to them. Donating directly to charities is always good, but when you
                        have little time, being able to combine tasks can save you a lot of trouble.
