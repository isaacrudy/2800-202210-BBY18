                        #Teamseas is a worldwide campaign to raise a target $30M to remove 30M pounds of junk from the
                        ocean, rivers and beaches.
                        This coinsides with the sister campaign #Teamtrees. With the support of the internet, the people
                        at #teamtrees and #teamseas has smashed the target exceeding all expectations.
                        The funded cleanup work beings in 2022 and is scheduled to be completed in three years.
                        The money raised will go towards two not-for-profit organizations, Ocean conservancy and The
                        Ocean Cleanup.
                        Each dollar will be matched and verified pound for dollar until the goal is met.

                        Back in 2019, the internet challenged MrBeast to raise money to replant our forests.
                        With the help of Mark Rober who is a Educational YouTuber and an ex-NASA engineer, along with
                        hundreds of other YouTube creators, they sought to spread the word and knowledge of the goal of
                        this campaign.
                        Currently, after 3 years of when this campaign has launched, they have raised over $23M where
                        each dollar is a new sapling waiting to be grown.
                        Now with the project still underway and $13M trees have been planted so far, there is still a
                        chance to recover our precious forests.

                        No Kid Hungry is a national campaign run by Share Our Strength, a nonprofit working to solve
                        problems of hunger and poverty in the United States and around the world.
                        After 25 years of successfully investing in local nonprofits and helping find the best
                        approaches to eradicating poverty and hunger, Share Our Strength launched No Kid Hungry in 2010.
                        As a child hunger organization, ending childhood hunger is our primary focus, though Share Our
                        Strength continues to invest in and develop other campaigns.
